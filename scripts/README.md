# Scripts

This directory contains scripts to deploy, migrate, or interact with Steak Hub smart contract.

## How to Use

Insteall dependencies:

```bash
cd steak/scripts
npm install
```

Import the key to use to sign transactions. You will be prompted to enter the seed phrase and a password to encrypt the private key. By default, the encrypted key will be saved at `steak/scripts/keys/{keyname}.json`. The script also provide commands to list or remove keys.

```bash
ts-node 1_manage_keys.ts add <keyname> [--key-dir string]
```

To deploy the contract, create a JSON file containing the instantiation message, and use the following command. You will be prompted to enter the password to decrypt the private key.

```bash
ts-node 2_deploy.ts \
  --network mainnet|testnet|localterra \
  --key keyname \
  --msg /path/to/instantiate_msg.json
```

To stake Native Token and mint Steak:

```bash
ts-node 4_bond.ts \
  --network mainnet|testnet|localterra \
  --key keyname \
  --contract-address terra... \
  --amount 1000000
```

Other scripts work similarly to the examples above.
